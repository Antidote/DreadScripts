# Dread Scripts

This is a 1:1 decompilation of Metroid Dread's compiled Lua scripts.

## Disclaimer:

It is advised to _only_ use scripts for the corresponding game version. Each updated decompilation will be sorted by directories labeled with the game version they derrived from.

## Usage

The aforementioned version-labeled folders are setup as mods for [Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx). It can work with other emulators that have mod support and jailbroken hardware, the installation of which may vary for each case. To install mods, the mod path must first be made. Right-click on Metroid Dread from the Ryujinx UI an select `Open Mods Directory`. Mods are controlled by title ID, `010093801237c000` is the ID for Metroid Dread, so mods go under `<data>\mods\contents\010093801237c000\`. Each mod needs to have its own sub-directory. This will help separate them and give them names to identify them. Please double check the paths if a mod is not loading. Note that `<data>` may vary and represents wherever the emulator, homebrew, or system stores Switch content.

## Todo

- Update for game release 2.0.0
